## Overview

The mpc_local_planner package implements a plugin to the
base_local_planner of the 2D navigation stack. It provides a generic and
versatile model predictive control implementation. The package already
provides standard realizations like minimum-time and quadratic-form
receding-horizon control, but can also be easily extended by deriving
from one of the various interface classes.

The following paper describes the approach:

## Get Started

The best way to get started is to look at one of the example
configurations in the
[related GitHub repository](https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/mpc_local_planner/tree/master/mpc_local_planner_examples).
The `cfg` directory contains several example *yaml* configurations.

It is **highly recommended** to be familiar with the
[navigation](navigation) stack and all its components (global planner,
local planner, costmap_2d, \...).

It might also be helpful to be familiar with the
[teb_local_planner](teb_local_planner) as the planners are very similar
from the API and parameter point of view (the teb_local_planner wiki
page already provides several tutorials which do not exist for this
planner yet).

Please also have a look at the repository's
[wiki page](https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/mpc_local_planner/wiki).
