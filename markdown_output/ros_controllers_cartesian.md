## Rationale

As opposed to joint-based control, Cartesian control is often more
intuitive for programmers to specify how a tool (robot end-effector)
should move in their application. For instance, gluing, grinding,
polishing and all sorts of other surface-related tasks benefit from a
straight-forward task formulation with Cartesian coordinates.

Currently, there is no support of Cartesian control in ROS. Yet, the
number of OEMs, whose drivers support Cartesian control interfaces is
growing. This set of packages aims at filling this gap and get you
started with Cartesian control.

## Major features at a glance

-   **Add Cartesian functionality to ROS control**. This brings new
    interfaces for controller design, such as a
    ```PoseCommandInterface```, a
    ```TwistCommandInterface```, and a new Cartesian trajectory
    definition. Example controllers include a
    ```TwistController``` and a
    ```CartesianTrajectoryController```.

-   **Enable Cartesian trajectory control** in your applications.
    Specify your task comfortably with waypoints in task space. ROS-side
    interpolation and streaming of setpoints over the new interfaces is
    only one of several alternatives. See the
    [`cartesian_control_msgs`](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_cartesian_control_msgs)
    package for details about the interface definition.

-   **Use (conventional) ROS control** for Cartesian trajectory
    execution. You don't need to change anything in the driver's
    HW-abstraction of your specific robot if that supports current ROS
    control. The `position_controllers/CartesianTrajectoryController`
    controller uses an IK solver to generate joint commands from the
    Cartesian trajectory during runtime. Thus, existing joint command
    interfaces (which should be present in most ROS-Control-enabled
    robot drivers) are sufficient for using this controller.

-   **Hand-over control to the robot by forwarding trajectories**. Two
    new interfaces ```CartesianTrajectoryInterface``` and
    ```JointTrajectoryInterface``` let robots take care of
    driver-side interpolation to achieve best performance. This
    functionality lives in a
    [separate repository](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_passthrough_controllers).

-   **Speed-scale trajectory execution**. All trajectory executions
    (both Cartesian and joint-based) can be speed-scaled within 0 to
    100% at runtime. This gives you flexibility in setting-up new
    applications and during test runs. Changing this continuously even
    lets you reshape trajectory execution without re-teaching. This
    functionality lives in a
    [separate repository](https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS_scaled_controllers)
    but is used for controllers in this repository.
