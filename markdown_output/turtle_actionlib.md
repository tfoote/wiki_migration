## Overview

This tutorial package provides a \`shape_server\` and example
\`shape_client\` for drawing regular polygons with the
\`turtlesim_node\`. The default client will draw a pentagon in
\`turtlesim\`.

The \`Shape.action\` is defined below: ```
#goal definition
int32 edges
float32 radius
---
#result definition
float32 interior_angle
float32 apothem
---
#feedback
```

## Running the Tutorial Code

To run the default example, start by getting the required dependencies
and making the package.

```
$ rosdep install turtle_actionlib
$ rosmake turtle_actionlib
```

Then in separate terminals \`rosrun\` the following nodes:
```
$ rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node
$ rosrun turtle_actionlib shape_server
$ rosrun turtle_actionlib shape_client
```

You will see:
